### Programming and Algorithms 1 Homework Repository

Welcome to the Programming and Algorithms 1 homework repository! This repository contains my homework assignments for the FIT CTU (Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University) course "Programming and Algorithms 1." All the code in this repository is written in the C programming language.
Assignment texts are not present because I'm afraid of breaking some copyrights.
